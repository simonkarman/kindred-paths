# Kindred Paths
A tool for managing the cards in Kindred Paths, the custom Magic the Gathering set by [Simon Karman](https://simonkarman.nl).

## Installation
Make sure you have the [Card Conjurer](https://github.com/Investigamer/cardconjurer/) Docker image installed and running. You can do this by running, cloning that repository and running the following commands:

```bash
```



You can start the server and client in development mode.

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now, the server should be available on `http://localhost:4101` and the client should be available on `http://localhost:4100`.

> For development purposes Card Conjurer will now be available on `http://localhost:4102`.

Happy coding!

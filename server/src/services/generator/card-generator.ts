Card Schema definition:
${JSON.stringify(GenerateCardSchema.shape, null, 2)}

Additional information:
- Do NOT add reminder text to cards.
- Ensure that planeswalkers have an empty subtypes array.
- Use "~" to represent the card's name in rules text.
- Power and toughness should be included for creatures and vehicle artifacts only.
- Loyalty should be included for planeswalkers only.

When generating the samples, ensure that at least the RULES are meaningfully different from all previous samples.
Other properties can be similar or changed too. But keep in mind the stick the the prompt of the user.
Please generate cards with rules that are DIFFERENT and UNIQUE from the above.
Avoid duplicating concepts, themes, or characteristics in the rules that have already been used.
These samples are variants of the same prompt so it is okay if some of the properties are similar, but the rules must be different.
You can use different mechanics, themes, or abilities to achieve this.

Make sure to align the mana cost and name with the rules you choose.`;
